Predator-prey dynamical systems are idealized descriptions of 
behavior in the animal kingdom, an unforgiving domain from 
which humans imagine their superior evolutionary development 
and civilization afford them some protection.

This simulation of a repeated game illustrates a mathematical 
notion of class distinction within a population. Populations 
are partitioned into disjoint classes. One class dominates 
another if, at each repetition of the game, its payoff is a fixed
proportion of  population of the other class. 

In this simulation, the classes are the Bourgeois and the
Proletariat. The Bourgeois dominate the Proletariat in the
above sense. The payoff to the Proletariat at each repetition
of the game is a population and play independent constant.

Each play of the repeated game proceeds as follows.  Two members
of the total population are selected uniformly at random. If
both are Proletariat, the Proletariat population is increased
by a constant amount. If one is Proletariat and the other
is Bourgeois, a fixed fraction of the Proletariat becomes Bourgeois.
Finally, if both are Bourgeois, one of them dies and the other
becomes Proletariat.
