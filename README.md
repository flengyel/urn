## Introduction ##
Predator-prey dynamical systems are idealized descriptions of 
behavior in the animal kingdom, an unforgiving domain from 
which humans imagine their superior evolutionary development 
and civilization afford them some protection.

This simulation of a repeated game illustrates a mathematical notion 
of economic class dominance within a population. A *repeated class-payoff game* is one in which a popolation players is partitioned into n classes. A move of the game is a selection of n players from the population; payoffs are to each class depending on the classes of the players. One class dominates another if,  at each repetition of the game, the payoff to the class is an asymmetric zero-sum  transfer of utility from the other class, proportional to the population of the other class.  

The idea to define economic class dominance as a population-dependent 
income transfer  from one class to another was suggested by a New York Times 
article of December 25, 2009, entitled "[At Tiny Rates, 
Saving Money Costs Investors](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/your-money/26rates.html)." 
The Times reported that "...risk-averse investors are 
effectively financing a second bailout of financial institutions, 
many of which have also raised fees and interest rates on credit cards."
William H. Gross of Pimco was quoted. "...a significant part 
of the governmentâ€™s plan to repair the financial system and 
the economy is to pay savers nothing and allow damaged financial 
institutions to earn a nice, guaranteed spread," he said. 


In this simulation, a population is partitioned into two classes
called the Bourgeois, representing the banks, and the Proletariat, 
representing the depositors, who earn a fixed working wage.  The 
Bourgeois dominate the Proletariat in the above sense. 
Income in this simulation is identified with number of offspring.
The payoff to the Proletariat  at each repetition of the game is a population-independent
constant fixed for the entire simulation.

Each play of the repeated game proceeds as follows.  Two members
of the total population are selected uniformly at random. If
both are Proletariat, the Proletariat population is increased
by a constant amount. If one is Proletariat and the other
is Bourgeois, a fixed fraction of the Proletariat becomes Bourgeois.
Finally, if both are Bourgeois, one of them dies and the other
becomes Proletariat.

## Examples ##
Load the source code `prole.R` into an `R` session with `source('prole.R')`.

### Creating a simulation ###
Create a `PROLE` object (called `sim` for definiteness) with `sim <- new("PROLE", 1000, 2, 30, 40, 0.031)`, for example.

### Simulation plot ###
Plot the simulation with `plot(sim)`. This will produce `ggplot2` output, such as the following.

### Density plot ###
The method `density(sim)` will produce a density plot of the Bourgeois and Proletariat population distributions for the simulation. The color-coded dashed lines indicate distribution
means. [<img src="https://github.com/flengyel/urn/raw/master/densityplot.png">](https://github.com/flengyel/urn/raw/master/densityplot.png)
