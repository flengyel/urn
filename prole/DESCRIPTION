Description: A predator-prey simulation in which the payoff
 to one population, called the Bourgeois, is a fixed fraction
 of the income of the other population, called the Proletariat,
 whose income is a population-independent constant. Two members 
 of the total population are selected uniformly at random. If 
 both are Proletariat, the Proletariat population is increased 
 by a fixed constant amount. If one is Proletariat and the other 
 is Bourgeois, a fixed fraction of the Proletariat becomes Bourgeois. 
 Finally, if both are Bourgeois, one of them dies and the other 
 becomes Proletariat.
